## Installation
they used a house analogy to explain the concept more concretely. a house requires a foundation, a coat of paint and some furniture, and the plumbing/electrical work to be set up. essentially i started with an html file, then i created a .css file in the command line and put in the visual elements via key words and a link from the css file to the html. after that, i had to create a JavaScript file in the command line and set up the "plumbing and electrical work" by means of establishing the neccesary arrays and calling those processes into action via specific coding elements in js

## Usage
